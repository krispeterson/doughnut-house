# Doughnut House (MVP)

## Why “Doughnut House”?

The name **Doughnut House** is inspired by ideas from *Doughnut Economics*, developed by economist **Kate Raworth**, which frames sustainability as living within a “safe and just space” between social foundations and planetary boundaries.

For more on this framework, see:

- https://www.kateraworth.com

Rather than applying that framework at the level of nations or global systems, Doughnut House brings the lens **much closer to home**.

This project focuses on:
- **Individual and household-level choices**
- The things we interact with every day under a single roof
- How ordinary decisions (appliances, energy use, travel, habits) connect to broader environmental impacts

The “**doughnut**” reflects the idea of operating within limits — understanding tradeoffs, constraints, and boundaries — while the “**house**” grounds those ideas in lived, practical reality.

Doughnut House is not about prescribing behavior or enforcing ideals.  
It is about **making impacts visible**, surfacing assumptions, and helping people explore how everyday choices relate to the systems we are part of.

In short:
- *Doughnut* → systems thinking and limits  
- *House* → personal scale, tangible decisions  

The goal is curiosity, understanding, and informed exploration — not judgment.


This is a **working MVP scaffold** for the Doughnut House project:
- Node 20 (ESM)
- TypeScript core engine
- JSON-driven plugins
- Validation (AJV)
- Unit tests (Vitest)
- RN-facing persistence helpers (logic-only)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run validate
npm test
```

This repo is intentionally **logic-first**. UI and AR layers sit on top of this core.

## Ethical Use

Doughnut House is intended to support transparency, education, and
informed decision-making around environmental impact.

While the MIT License permits broad reuse, we ask downstream users to:
- Avoid deceptive or manipulative representations of impact
- Preserve transparency of assumptions and uncertainty
- Not present estimates as precise or authoritative measurements
